## Tech Stack

### Highlights

1. Front-End with Next.js: Next.js, a versatile front-end framework, was utilized to create an interactive and seamless user interface. This choice facilitated efficient rendering and enhanced user experience.

2. Backend with Next.js Serverless Functions: I employed Next.js serverless functions to construct a robust and agile backend. This approach allowed me to handle API requests, data retrieval, and database interactions with precision.

3. Database and Data Storage: The database architecture is based on Supabase Serverless Postgres DB, ensuring data integrity and optimal storage solutions.

4. CI/CD Pipelines: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is facilitated through GitHub Actions, guaranteeing a reliable and efficient codebase.
